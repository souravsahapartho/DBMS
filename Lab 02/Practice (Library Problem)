You are asked to create and manage a simple library database by writing SQL statements to perform the following tasks:

Part A — Table Creation & Data Insertion

Create a table named library_books with the following attributes:

book_id (VARCHAR(20), Primary Key)

book_title (VARCHAR(40), NOT NULL)

author (VARCHAR(30))

price (INT)

Create another table named members with the following attributes:

member_id (INT, Primary Key)

member_name (VARCHAR(30))

membership_type (VARCHAR(20))

borrowed_book (VARCHAR(20)) which references book_id of library_books table.

Insert the following records into library_books:

('B101', 'Database Systems', 'Navathe', 500)

('B102', 'Clean Code', 'Robert Martin', 700)

('B103', 'Algorithms', 'CLRS', 900)

Insert the following records into members:

(1, 'Rahim', 'Regular', 'B101')

(2, 'Karim', 'Premium', 'B103')

Part B — Table Modification

Add a new column email (VARCHAR(40)) to the members table.

Add two new columns to library_books:

published_year (INT)

category (VARCHAR(20))

Modify the data type of the price column in library_books to FLOAT(6,2).

Delete the membership_type column from the members table.

Rename the column member_name in the members table to full_name.

Rename the table library_books to books_archive.

Finally, delete the entire members table.
