You are required to design and manipulate two relational database tables for a university course management system. Follow the steps below:

Part A — Table Creation & Insertion

Create a table named course with the following attributes:

course_code (VARCHAR(20), Primary Key)

course_name (VARCHAR(20), Not Null)

credit (INT)

Create another table named student with the following attributes:

id (INT, Primary Key)

name (VARCHAR(30))

age (INT)

course_taken (VARCHAR(20)) which must reference the course_code column of the course table.

Insert the following rows into the course table:

('CSE 101', 'SPL', 3)

('CSE 102', 'SPL Lab', 1)

('CSE 103', 'OOP', 3)

('CSE 104', 'OOP Lab', 1)

Insert the following rows into the student table:

(1, 'ABC', 19, 'CSE 101')

(2, 'XYZ', 24, 'CSE 104')

Part B — Table Modification

Add a new column Email (VARCHAR(20)) to the student table.

Add two more columns to the student table:

CGPA (FLOAT(3,2))

Hobby (VARCHAR(20))

Modify the data type of the credit column in the course table to FLOAT(2,1).

Remove the Hobby column from the student table.

Rename the name column in the student table to fullname (VARCHAR(20)).

Rename the course table to university_courses.

Finally, delete the student table completely.
